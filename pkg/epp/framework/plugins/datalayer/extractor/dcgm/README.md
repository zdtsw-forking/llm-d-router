# DCGM Extractor

**Type:** `dcgm-extractor`

The DCGM Extractor converts the Prometheus metrics response from a
`dcgm-data-source` into a per-endpoint GPU utilization attribute consumed by
the generic `endpoint-attribute-filter` and `endpoint-attribute-scorer`
(configurable for any scalar attribute, not hardwired to GPU).

## What it does

1. Receives the parsed Prometheus metric families forwarded by `dcgm-data-source`.
2. Looks up the `DCGM_FI_DEV_GPU_UTIL` metric family.
3. Keeps samples that belong to this endpoint:
   - If a sample has a `pod` label and the endpoint has a `Name`, only
     matching samples are kept (DaemonSet multi-pod payloads).
   - If the sample has no `pod` label, it is kept (sidecar / unlabeled payloads).
4. Aggregates matching samples using `max` (highest-utilized GPU for the pod).
5. Normalizes the value from 0-100 to [0.0, 1.0].
6. Stores the result as `ScalarMetricValue` on the corresponding endpoint.

## Attributes produced

- **Type:** `ScalarMetricValue` (from `attribute/metrics`)
- **Attribute:** `GPUUtilization`
- **Producer:** `dcgm-extractor`

## Configuration

No configuration parameters.

## Cluster prerequisites

- **DCGM Exporter** must be running on the cluster and accessible from the
  EPP. See [`source/dcgm/README.md`](../../source/dcgm/README.md) for
  data source configuration (port, DaemonSet vs sidecar, TLS).

## EPP config example

Use the generic `endpoint-attribute-filter` and `endpoint-attribute-scorer`
to consume the produced attribute. Their `attribute`/`attributeKey` and
`producer` parameters must match the pair above; `producer` defaults to the
core metrics extractor, so it must be set explicitly here.
