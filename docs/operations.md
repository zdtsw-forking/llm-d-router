# llm-d Router Container Sizing Guide

This guide provides resource sizing recommendations for both the Endpoint Picker (EPP) and the Envoy Proxy containers in the llm-d Router. Sizing recommendations are based on empirical benchmark results under various agentic and high-throughput workloads.

---

## 1. Endpoint Picker (EPP) Sizing

The EPP acts as the routing intelligence engine. Its resource usage scales primarily with the total request rate (throughput), the complexity of prefix cache matching configuration, and the number of model-serving pods.

### Sizing Recommendations

#### CPU Allocation
- **Rule of Thumb**: Allocate **0.5 to 1.0 CPU cores per request/second** of expected throughput for large agentic workloads (approximately 100k input / 1k output tokens).
- **Scaling Behavior**: CPU utilization scales linearly with the request rate, and increases with both the input prompt size and output token length.
- **Prefix Matching Overhead**: Increasing the `maxPrefixBlocksToMatch` parameter increases EPP CPU utilization. At lower throughputs, a large prefix block limit (such as 6250 blocks) can increase EPP CPU utilization by over 100% compared to a small limit (256 blocks) due to the overhead of searching and matching blocks.
- **Idle CPU Scaling**: Idle CPU usage of the EPP container scales with the number of model-serving pods in the cluster due to continuous metric scraping. For example, in a cluster with 100 model-serving pods, the idle CPU usage of the EPP container grows to approximately **7.5 cores**.

#### Memory Allocation
- **Base Memory**: EPP memory usage is relatively low and stable with small output token requests, but scales with the number of concurrent inflight requests.
- **Inflight Requests Impact**: Memory usage increases with the number of concurrent inflight requests and the output (decode) token length.
- **Sizing Guidelines**:
  - For a request rate of 50 to 100 requests/second with 1k output tokens, EPP requires between **4 GiB and 6 GiB** of memory.
  - For workloads with longer output lengths (such as 5k output tokens), memory usage can reach **20+ GiB** due to the accumulation of state for concurrent inflight requests.

#### Scaling Modes (Active-Active vs. Active-Passive)
The EPP's scaling behavior and effectiveness are highly dependent on the configured high availability (HA) mode:

- **Active-Passive Mode**: Only one EPP replica actively serves Envoy external processing (`ext-proc`) requests at a time, while the others remain in standby. 
  - **Sizing Impact**: Scaling the replica count does **not** increase the overall EPP throughput capacity or impact resource sizing, as only the active replica handles requests.
- **Active-Active Mode**: Multiple EPP replicas actively share and load-balance incoming requests, providing **near-linear throughput scaling**:

  | Replicas | Scaling Factor |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | 1 | 1.0x |
  | 2 | 2.0x |
  | 3 | 2.7x |
  | 4 | 3.5x |

  - **Warning (Prefix Routing)**: **Active-Active mode should be avoided when using approximate prefix routing.** Because EPP replicas do not share prefix state, each replica only has visibility into the prefix state of the requests it has individually handled. This partition of state significantly degrades prefix cache hit rates, making prefix caching highly inefficient.
  - For more technical details and context on EPP replica state sync and scaling limitations, see [Issue #1290](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-router/issues/1290).

### Performance Reference Data

The following tables present empirical benchmark results for EPP running with llm-d-simulator simulating Qwen/Qwen3-8B.

#### Throughput and Prefix Block Sizing
This table shows peak CPU and memory utilization for EPP under a 100k token workload (95k system prompt, 5k question prompt, and 1k output tokens) when using approximate prefix caching across 100 model-serving pods.

| Configuration | Request Rate (Req/s) | maxPrefixBlocksToMatch | Peak CPU (Cores) | Peak Memory (GiB) | Scheduler P50 Latency (s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Small Prefix Match | 5.0 | 256 | 1.19 | 0.26 | 0.00010 |
| Large Prefix Match | 5.0 | 6250 | 3.82 | 0.65 | 0.00010 |
| Small Prefix Match | 98.7 | 256 | 35.17 | 2.46 | 0.00014 |
| Large Prefix Match | 98.8 | 6250 | 46.50 | 3.41 | 0.00020 |

Configuration used: [#1287](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-router/issues/1287#issuecomment-4666058475).
These were run against 0.9.0 EPP container image.

#### Output Length and Prefix Matching Complexity
This table shows EPP peak resource usage at a constant request rate of 50 requests/second with a 100k input token workload, varying the output token length and the `maxPrefixBlocksToMatch` configuration.

| Input Tokens | Output Tokens | maxPrefixBlocksToMatch | Peak CPU (Cores) | Peak Memory (GiB) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 100k | 500 | 256 | 15.13 | 2.27 |
| 100k | 500 | 2048 | 17.14 | 3.76 |
| 100k | 1000 | 256 | 17.51 | 3.66 |
| 100k | 1000 | 2048 | 20.28 | 5.23 |
| 100k | 5000 | 1024 | 30.95 | 12.54 |
| 100k | 10000 | 512 | 32.53 | 12.54 |

Configuration used: [#1287](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-router/issues/1287#issuecomment-4619775397)
These were run against 0.9.0 EPP container image.

## 2. Envoy Proxy Sizing (Standalone Mode)

When running the llm-d Router in **Standalone Mode**, the Envoy proxy container runs in the same pod alongside the EPP container. Sizing the Envoy proxy container depends primarily on the request throughput (requests/second) and the request/response payload size (concurrency of streaming data).

### Sizing Recommendations

#### CPU Allocation
- **Scaling Behavior**: Envoy's CPU usage scales linearly with the total throughput (requests/second).
- **Sizing Guidelines**:
  - For lower throughput (e.g., < 10 requests/second), **1.2 to 2.0 CPU cores** is sufficient.
  - For higher throughput of large contexts (e.g., 100 requests/second with 100k/1k tokens), allocate at least **8 CPU cores** (peak usage observed at **7.27 cores**).
  - For very high throughput of smaller contexts (e.g., 892 requests/second with 10k/1k tokens), allocate at least **10 CPU cores** (peak usage observed at **8.78 cores**).

#### Memory Allocation
- **Sizing Guidelines**: Envoy's memory footprint remains extremely stable and is primarily influenced by the number of concurrent active connections and buffer sizes. Allocate at least **2 GiB of memory** (peak memory usage is stable between **1.3 and 1.4 GiB** across all tested throughputs and context lengths).

### Performance Reference Data

The following table presents empirical benchmark results for the Envoy proxy container in Standalone Mode under different workloads:

| Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Throughput (Req/s) | Peak CPU (Cores) | Peak Memory (GiB) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 100k | 1k | 10.0 | 1.20 | 1.30 |
| 100k | 1k | 100.0 | 7.27 | < 1.40 |
| 10k | 1k | 892.0 | 8.78 | 1.40 |

## 3. Helm Configuration Example

For deployments managed via Helm (such as using the `llm-d-router-standalone` chart), both the EPP and the Envoy proxy container resource requests and limits can be configured in a custom values file, such as `resource_overrides.yaml`.

Below is an example `resource_overrides.yaml` snippet configured to support a throughput of up to 50 requests/second for 100k/1k agentic requests in Standalone Mode:

```yaml
router:
  # Endpoint Picker (EPP) Container Resources
  epp:
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "32"
        memory: "64Gi"
      limits:
        memory: "128Gi"

  # Envoy Proxy Container Resources
  proxy:
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "8"
        memory: "2Gi"
      limits:
        memory: "4Gi"
```

To apply these values during deployment, run the Helm install or upgrade command with your custom values file:

```bash
helm install optimize-baseline ./config/charts/llm-d-router-standalone -f resource_overrides.yaml
```
